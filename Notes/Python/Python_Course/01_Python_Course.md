# Introduction to Python
 Python is an interpreter-based language. 

**What is an interpreter-based language?**
Interpreter-based means no compiler compiles the code. An interpreter interprets the code to run. So Python is not a compiled language, it is an interpreter language.

Python has a dynamic type feature. That feature is one of the most important features of the language.
We can separate programming languages based on the type system.
- Static typing languages
- Dynamic typing languages

We declare a variable and that variable only be the same type for its lifetime in static-type languages. For example, programming languages such as C, Pascal, C#, and Java have static-type features.

Python is a dynamic type language, so there is no type declaration. A variable can be the type that we assign to it. Programming languages such as JavaScript, R, Perl, and Ruby have the dynamic type feature.

Python is a high-level language. The high level means it is close to human understanding.

Python is an easy language to learn.

Python is a multi-paradigm language.
- Procedural programming
- Object-oriented programming
- Functional programming

Python has a very wide library support. This is called "Python Standard Library". Having this kind of huge library support is called "Batteries included ".  A part of the Python library is procedural and part of it is object oriented.

Python is a widely preferred language in the math field. Because the design of the language is suitable for math operations and the language is a high-level language.

Python is not standardized by the organizations such as ISO and IEEE. Python.org documents the python. The formal document for Python is "**The Python Language Reference**". Also, there is a document for the Python standard library which is "**The Python Standard Library**". Both documents are in "python.org".

## Historical Development of Python Language
The first version (version 0.9) of the python was established in 1991.

There is a breakpoint in the Python versions. A significant difference exists between the before Python version 3 and after.

# Python Implementations
A program called interpreter is needed to run the Python code. The interpreters are also called "Python Implementation".

The first Python implementation is "**CPython**" and maintained by the "Python Software Foundation" (python.org). The CPython interpreter was written in C language and for this reason, it is called CPython.

**Jython** is another Python implementation. Jython produces Java byte code for code written in Python. It works as a compiler. The Java classes can be used in the Jython.

**IronPython** is another Python implementation. It is the same as Jython but not for Java it is for C#. It can use the classes of the .NET. The Visual Studio IDE of the Microsoft supports the IronPython.

**PyPy** is another Python implementation. PyPy runs the code as a JIT Compilation (Just in Time Compilation), not as the interpreter. Therefore it is the fastest Python implementation.

**MicroPython** is for microcontrollers.

A list of all Python implementations can be found at the https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonImplementations.

# Python Distributions
A Python distribution is a package that includes the Python interpreter and some other tools (for example pip). For example, distributions include an IDE too.

CPython is a Python implementation and also a Python Distribution.

**Anaconda** is a Python distribution and uses the CPython interpreter.

**ActivePython** is another Python distribution.

A list of all Python distributions can be found at the https://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonDistributions.
